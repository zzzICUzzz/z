         Almost 16,000 cases of nicotine exposure are reported to United States regional poison control centers annually [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Cigarettes (approximately 5400 annual cases) and e-cigarettes (approximately 4400 annual cases) account for most United States nicotine exposures [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The majority of nicotine exposures are exploratory ingestions in young children. However, a significant number arise from attempts at self-harm in adolescents and adults [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,4
         </a>
         ]. Concentrated nicotine solutions, such as those found in e-cigarette refills and pesticides, are the most dangerous [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3,5,6
         </a>
         ]. Ingestion of even a small amount of these concentrated liquids can cause serious toxicity. Deaths are rare but have occurred in infants and toddlers [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, exposure to nicotine-containing plants (most commonly, the tobacco plant [
         <em>
          Nicotiana
         </em>
         tabacum]) is infrequent, with approximately 100 annual exposures reported to United States regional poison control centers [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Most nicotine-plant exposures result in mild or moderate symptoms. However, selected plants (eg, poison hemlock,
         <em>
          Conium maculatum
         </em>
         ) have rarely been associated with serious toxicity and death [

         Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are present in the brain, the spinal cord (postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons), and at the neuromuscular junction [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Under normal conditions, acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter at these receptors. The nAChR is a cation ionic channel, which causes cell depolarization when activated. Repeated agonism, however, can lead to functional paralysis of the receptor. As a result, nicotine toxicity classically manifests in a biphasic pattern [

         Nicotine and neonicotinoids (found in pesticides) differ in their behavior at the nAChr. Nicotine can behave as a full or partial agonist [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]; neonicotinoids can act as agonists, partial agonists, or antagonists [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. In general, neonicotinoid exposures are less likely to cause major toxicity except after large intentional ingestions. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Neonicotinoids'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although also causing neuromuscular dysfunction, organophosphates inhibit acetylcholinesterase, causing a buildup of excess acetylcholine, leading to repeated depolarization at the neuromuscular junction  (

          Inhalation
         </strong>
         – Cigarette and e-cigarette inhalation exposures account for a small minority of nicotine exposures. Cigarette smoking in patients with no prior nicotine exposure can cause self- limited cough, nausea, and vomiting [

          23

         ]. Because of the higher concentration of nicotine during e-cigarette inhalation, more serious poisoning is possible. For example, in a study of 10 e-cigarette inhalational exposures in children reported to a regional poison control center, excessive vaping from an e-cigarette was associated with vomiting, marked tachycardia, lethargy, seizures, and hallucinations in two adolescents [

          Absorption

        <p>

         Because nicotine is a weak base (pKa = 8.0), it is more readily absorbed from basic or neutral environments than acidic ones. Gastric absorption may be delayed or incomplete. While precise pharmacokinetics following oral overdose are not well described, peak plasma concentrations were reached one to two hours following oral administration of a nicotine-replacement product [

          When did it happen?
         </strong>
         – Signs and symptoms of nicotine poisoning usually develop soon after exposure (typically within one hour). Important exceptions that may be associated with delayed toxicity include transdermal nicotine patch ingestion and some patients with dermal exposure to wet tobacco (green tobacco sickness). (See

          How did it happen?
         </strong>
         – With the exception of exposure to concentrated nicotine solutions, most exploratory exposures in children or unintentional exposures in adults result in minimal or no toxicity [

          1,13

          Organophosphates or carbamates
         </strong>
         – Organophosphate or carbamate poisoning is the major toxic exposure, other than nicotine, that presents with cholinergic effects. Organophosphate poisoning may be difficult to differentiate from nicotine poisoning because either toxin can cause cholinergic effects and/or muscle fasciculations followed by paralysis [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Low cholinesterase activity level as measured by decreased plasma and/or red blood cell cholinesterase levels indicates organophosphate poisoning (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/339.html" rel="external">
          "Organophosphate and carbamate poisoning", section on 'Laboratory abnormalities'
         </a>
         ). However, results of these studies are typically not rapidly available, and interpretation of cholinesterase levels can be difficult due to variation in enzyme activity among patients and day-to-day variations within the same patient. Unlike organophosphates, nicotine does not bind to cholinesterase and should not impact enzyme activity.

          Gastrointestinal decontamination
         </strong>
         — Although evidence of clinical benefit in patients who ingest nicotine or tobacco products is lacking, activated charcoal can effectively bind to and reduce absorption of nicotine. For patients who present within one hour of a potentially toxic ingestion of nicotine or a tobacco product or within three hours of ingestion of a transdermal nicotine patch, we suggest administration of activated charcoal (dose: 1 g/kg up to 50 g; activated charcoal without
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12801" href="/z/d/drug information/12801.html" rel="external">

          "Gastrointestinal decontamination of the poisoned patient", section on 'Activated charcoal'

         Activated charcoal should not be given to patients with depressed mental status unless the airway is first secured. It is also contraindicated if there has been co-ingestion of a caustic substance or a hydrocarbon.

         may be attempted, but benefit of this approach is not established. Whenever possible, this decision should be made in consultation with a medical toxicologist. For patients who cannot protect their airway, endotracheal intubation should be performed before nasogastric aspiration. Otherwise, gastric lavage is generally not recommended for patients with nicotine, tobacco, or tobacco product ingestion because the potential risks of the procedure likely outweigh the benefit, considering that most nicotine exposures can be managed supportively.

          Clinical features and diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Nicotine poisoning is a clinical diagnosis based upon a history of nicotine or tobacco exposure. Salivation, nausea, vomiting, weakness, confusion, and dizziness are nonspecific symptoms associated with mild nicotine poisoning. Clinical features of severe poisoning include (see

          Decontamination
         </strong>
         – Carefully inspect the skin, vagina, rectum, and roof of the mouth and remove any transdermal nicotine patches. Patients with dermal exposure to concentrated liquid nicotine (eg, spilled e-cigarette liquid, nicotinic pesticides) or damp plant material (as in green tobacco sickness) should undergo external decontamination by health care providers in personal protective equipment. (See
