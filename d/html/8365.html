          Effectiveness of introducer (bougie) for tracheal intubation (January 2024)
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         While the tracheal tube introducer (commonly referred to as a "bougie") is widely considered an important tool for emergency intubation, high-quality evidence supporting its role has been limited. In a new systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 studies involving over 9000 adult patients, use of an introducer was associated with a higher overall rate of successful first-pass intubation compared with no introducer (in most cases an tracheal tube with a stylet) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. First-pass success rates were higher using an introducer regardless of the method of intubation (ie, direct versus video laryngoscopy) or where intubation was performed (eg, emergency department, intensive care unit, prehospital). The introducer was most effective in patients (n = 585 in five studies) with a Cormack-Lehane III or IV view. We consider the introducer an essential tool for difficult airway management that should be readily available in the emergency department. (See

        <p>
         Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is being increasingly used, but data are limited and the benefits are uncertain. In a recent meta-analysis of 11 studies (10,000 patients) who underwent CPR, compared with standard CPR, ECPR was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality and increased long-term favorable neurologic outcome and survival at one year [
         <a href="#rid2">

        <p>
         Beta blockade has the potential to limit harm from the adrenergic overdrive that occurs in septic shock. However, data to support heart rate control in patients with septic shock are limited. In a recent, unblinded randomized trial of 126 patients with septic shock-related tachycardia (heart rate ≥95/min) who were receiving norepinephrine, the beta blocker landiolol did not reduce organ failure as measured by the sequential organ failure assessment score [
         <a href="#rid3">

          Aerosol generation during noninvasive respiratory support modalities (October 2023)

        <p>
         Studies have reported conflicting data as to whether high levels of aerosols are generated when noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is used. In a 2023 systematic review including 12 studies in patients with respiratory infections and 15 studies in healthy volunteers, use of NIV or HFNO was not associated with increased generation of pathogen-laden aerosols compared with controls with unsupported normal or labored breathing, low-flow nasal oxygen, or oxygen or nonrebreather mask [

          4

         ]. Inconsistency among studies may reflect differences in sampling and detection methodologies and operating room ventilation. Notably, the National Health Service in the United Kingdom has removed mask ventilation, intubation, and extubation from its list of aerosol-generating procedures. (See

          No benefit of routine V-A ECMO in patients with AMI-related cardiogenic shock (September 2023)
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) can increase survival for patients with refractory cardiogenic shock caused by a variety of conditions. However, benefit from the routine use of V-A ECMO for cardiogenic shock due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is unproven. In a meta-analysis of four randomized trials (nearly 570 patients with AMI-related cardiogenic shock), routine V-A ECMO use showed no mortality benefit and increased rates of both major bleeding and peripheral vascular ischemia compared with medical care alone [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Limitations of this meta-analysis include crossover between groups and a low rate of active left ventricular uploading during ECMO therapy, which may have biased the study in favor of the control group. These findings suggest no meaningful benefit for the routine use of V-A ECMO for patients with AMI-related cardiogenic shock but does not preclude benefit in selected patients who are candidates for salvage procedures such as heart transplant.

          Time window to start dual antiplatelet therapy for high-risk TIA or minor ischemic stroke (January 2024)
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         There is evidence from several randomized trials that early initiation of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for select patients with high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke reduces the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. The evidence comes from trials that started DAPT within 12 to 24 hours of symptom onset. Results from the recent INSPIRES trial suggest that DAPT is still beneficial when started up to 72 hours after symptom onset [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Although the time window is extended by the results from INSPIRES, we start DAPT as soon as possible for patients with high-risk TIA or minor ischemic stroke. (See

          Guidelines for primary spontaneous pneumothorax (December 2023)

        <p>
         The British Thoracic Society (BTS) has recently issued new guidelines for the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) [

For patients with mild symptoms who are stable following adequate analgesia, monitored observation is preferred, while those with significant dyspnea should undergo a drainage procedure (eg, aspiration or catheter/chest tube thoracostomy). Also promoted was ambulatory management in select patients with adequate outpatient support. We agree with these recommendations. (See

          Timing of appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis (November 2023)

         Appendectomy is traditionally performed urgently to reduce the risk of perforation. However, a large randomized trial showed that patients with uncomplicated appendicitis (including those with appendicolith on computed tomography) who had an in-hospital delay of up to 24 hours before surgery had no increased risk of perforation or other complications compared with those who underwent surgery within 8 hours [

          Pulmonary embolism in patients with severe COPD exacerbation (September 2023)

        <p>
         Pulmonary embolism (PE) is an important potential trigger for COPD exacerbation. In a recent multicenter study, 1580 patients with COPD who were admitted to the hospital with acute worsening of respiratory symptoms were all screened for PE with computed tomography pulmonary angiogram within 48 hours of admission [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. PE was identified in 266 (17 percent), with 166 patients (11 percent) having PE involving the main or lobar pulmonary arteries. Purulent sputum production decreased the odds of PE by 60 percent. We suggest obtaining imaging for PE in patients requiring admission for COPD exacerbation who do not have evidence of other triggers (eg, infection or heart failure). (See

        <p>
         Topical anesthetics are helpful for the initial examination of a patient with a suspected corneal abrasion, but repeated use for the treatment of pain from a corneal abrasion is controversial. Prolonged use (ie, greater than 24 hours) may result in overuse or delayed corneal epithelial healing. A meta-analysis that included three trials in over 200 patients found that, compared with placebo, prolonged use of a topical anesthetic led to more eyes without complete resolution of epithelial defects by 24 to 48 hours (21 versus 15 percent), although the finding did not achieve statistical significance [

         In patients with cancer-related venous thromboembolism (VTE), accumulating evidence suggests that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) have similar efficacy and safety. In a recent randomized trial of over 670 patients with cancer-related VTE, there were no significant differences between rates at six months for recurrent VTE (6.1 [DOACs] versus 8.8 percent [LMWH]) and major bleeding (5.2 [DOACs] versus 5.6 percent [LMWH]) [

        <p>
         Diagnosing aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can be challenging in patients with isolated headache whose initial bleeding is minor because head computed tomography (CT) can miss small bleeds. Morbidity and mortality risk associated with misdiagnosis causes many centers to perform a follow-up lumbar puncture to assess for blood in the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with no evidence of bleeding on CT. However, the sensitivity of high-quality head CT ranges from 95.5 to 100 percent among patients with isolated headache when performed within six hours of the onset of symptoms, potentially rendering a follow-up lumbar puncture unnecessary.

          Invasive bacterial illness in febrile young infants with COVID-19 (July 2023)

        <p>
         Evidence is limited for the risk of invasive bacterial illness (IBI) in febrile young infants &lt;60 days old with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In one cohort study of 163 well-appearing febrile infants ≤60 days old (36 neonates) who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by multiplex viral panel testing, none had IBI compared with 0.5 percent of 448 infants with other viral infection (none had meningitis) and 1.3 percent of 320 infants with no viral infection on testing (one with meningitis) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. For well-appearing febrile infants ≤60 days old with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2, the risk of IBI appears to be low. For well-appearing infants 29 to 60 days, we suggest, at minimum, urinalysis and urine culture. It is also reasonable to obtain additional studies according to the American Academy of Pediatric Clinical Practice Guideline (

         There are few large-scale studies of pelvic avulsion fractures in children.

         Very young children are at higher risk of complications of airway management than children in older age groups; however, guidelines for infants have been lacking.

        <p>
         Use of videolaryngoscopy (VL) for emergency endotracheal intubation (ETI) in children provides a shared view of the procedure that permits an experienced physician observer to give assistance to the proceduralist. In a multicenter quality study of VL implementation during ETI in pediatric intensive care units with standardized coaching by an attending, over 3500 ETIs were performed with VL, and use of VL increased from 30 percent to 89 percent of ETIs over four years [

         </a>
         ]. Compared with direct laryngoscopy, VL was associated with lower adverse events (9 versus 15 percent). The majority of proceduralists were residents or fellows. These findings and prior studies confirm the safety of VL during emergency ETI in children and demonstrate the value of standardized coaching during the procedure for less experienced clinicians.

          Ultrasound guidance for lumbar puncture in children (August 2023)

        <p>
         Previous studies suggest that ultrasound guidance for lumbar puncture (LP) in children increases the chance of success. In a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials (over 700 infants and children), overall LP success rate was higher with ultrasound guidance compared with the use of external landmarks and palpation alone, but the difference was not significant  [

The overall quality of the evidence was considered low. Based on these findings, when performed by a trained provider, ultrasound guidance prior to LP may be useful in infants. Ultrasound guidance in older children is also reasonable, but evidence of benefit in these patients is lacking. (See

        <p>
         In emergency department (ED) patients who survive an opioid overdose, initiation of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is associated with decreased one-year mortality (approximately 5 percent without MOUD). However, prescribing rates are low and multiple barriers exist. A study of more than 20,000 ED visits for opioid toxicity in Canada found that even though MOUD prescribing increased between 2013 and 2020, it was still relatively low (&lt;6 percent) and was not improved by the publication of Canadian clinical practice guidelines in 2018 [

          22

         Methemoglobinemia is a potentially life-threatening condition in which heme iron becomes oxidized, preventing oxygen delivery.

          Avoiding intubation in acutely poisoned but stable, unresponsive adults (December 2023)

        </p>
        <p>
         In unresponsive patients with trauma or undifferentiated coma, tracheal intubation is generally recommended to protect the airway and prevent aspiration. However, the benefit of intubation is unclear in stable poisoned patients who have decreased level of consciousness but are oxygenating and ventilating adequately. In a randomized trial of 225 adults with acute poisoning and coma (GCS score ≤8), compared with airway management at the physician’s discretion, individuals not intubated unless hypoxia, seizure, vomiting, or hypotension developed had a lower likelihood of mechanical ventilation (18 versus 60 percent), intensive care unit admission (40 versus 66 percent), or adverse events from intubation (6 versus 15 percent); they also had a lower risk of pneumonia [

         Serum ethylene glycol (EG) concentrations are usually measured by gas chromatography, which is not widely offered by hospital clinical laboratories, leading to diagnostic uncertainty, need for empiric treatment, and delays in confirmation. Some hospitals have adopted an EG enzyme-based glycerol dehydrogenase (GDH) assay modified from a veterinary assay and run on automated chemistry analyzers. A study of 118 patient blood samples found that using a 9 mg/dL threshold (well below a toxic concentration), the GDH assay had a 100 percent positive and negative predictive value compared with gas chromatography [

          Whole blood transfusion for severe traumatic hemorrhage (January 2024)
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         For severe traumatic hemorrhage, whole blood transfusion is an alternative to balanced component transfusion (1:1:1 ratio of packed red blood cells/plasma/platelets). In an observational study comparing these two approaches, low titer group O whole blood transfusion was associated with lower 24-hour mortality (8 versus 19 percent) and lower volume of blood products received at 72 hours (48 versus 82 mL/kg) [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. The survival benefit was greatest in patients with shock or coagulopathy. While this study suggests improved outcomes for whole blood transfusion, randomized trials are needed to determine which transfusion strategy might be superior and which patients would benefit the most. (See

          Impact of pediatric trauma centers on clinical outcomes (October 2023)

        <p>
         Level 1 pediatric trauma centers (PTC) (

          table 3
         </a>
         ) are the preferred sites for initial resuscitation and ongoing management of critically injured children. In a meta-analysis of 34 studies that evaluated children hospitalized for traumatic injury, treatment in a PTC was associated with lower mortality than in an adult trauma center (ATC, odds ratio 0.59) [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. Compared with an ATC, care of children with blunt trauma in a PTC was also associated with a lower likelihood of computed tomography or operative management for blunt solid organ injury. For seriously injured infants, children, and adolescents, these findings support treatment in a PTC. When a level 1 PTC is not available, these children should receive care at a hospital that has the highest level of pediatric trauma expertise and resources. (See

          Intraosseous access in hypotensive adult trauma patients (August 2023)
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Hypotensive trauma patients require rapid vascular access because any delay in resuscitation increases the odds of mortality; two large-bore peripheral intravenous lines (PIV) are recommended but placement may not be possible. In a prospective study of 1410 vascular access attempts in 581 hypotensive adult trauma patients, initial attempts with intraosseous cannula (IO) were associated with a significantly faster time to resuscitation (5.8 versus 6.7 minutes); this difference was more pronounced in patients without established prehospital access [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. IO access had higher success rates compared with PIV or central venous catheter (CVC; 93 versus 67 versus 59 percent, respectively). These findings support IO access for hypotensive adult trauma patients as an option when PIV is difficult or not possible and either before or simultaneously with a CVC in patients without a peripheral IV.
