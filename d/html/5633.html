         Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas. Mortality ranges from 3 percent in patients with interstitial edematous pancreatitis to 17 percent in patients who develop pancreatic necrosis [

         This topic reviews the management of acute pancreatitis. Our recommendations are largely consistent with the American Gastroenterological Association, the American College of Gastroenterology, and the International Association of Pancreatology/American Pancreatic Association guidelines for the treatment of acute pancreatitis [

         At initial evaluation, the severity of acute pancreatitis should be assessed by clinical examination to assess for early fluid losses, organ failure (particularly cardiovascular, respiratory, or renal compromise)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87718" href="/z/d/graphic/87718.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), measurement of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) score  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69207" href="/z/d/graphic/69207.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid8">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         We perform the following laboratory tests to help establish the severity of acute pancreatitis and guide management. These include a complete metabolic panel, serum calcium, complete blood count, serum triglycerides and lactate. Although measurement of serum amylase and lipase is useful for diagnosis of pancreatitis, serial measurements in patients with acute pancreatitis are not useful to predict disease severity, prognosis, or for altering management.
        </p>
        <p>
         Routine abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan is not recommended at initial presentation in patients with acute pancreatitis unless there is diagnostic uncertainty because there is no evidence that CT improves clinical outcomes and the complete extent of pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis may only become clear 72 hours after the onset of acute pancreatitis [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Several other scoring systems also exist to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis based upon clinical, laboratory, radiologic risk factors, and serum markers but can be used only 24 to 48 hours after disease onset and have not been shown to be consistently superior to assessment of SIRS or the APACHE II score. The assessment of disease severity in acute pancreatitis is discussed in detail, separately. (See

         </span>
         The only effective treatment in the first 24 to 48 hours after the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is intravenous hydration. Significant third space losses due to inflammatory collections, increased permeability of vasculature resulting in transudation of fluid from intravascular to extravascular compartment, nausea and vomiting and inability to ingest adequate amounts of fluids, lead to increases in hematocrit blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, possible development of necrotizing pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis and acute kidney injury. Retrospective studies revealed that in the initial stages (within the first 12 to 24 hours) of acute pancreatitis, fluid replacement has been associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,11-13
         </a>
         ]. Persistent hemoconcentration at 24 hours has been associated with development of necrotizing pancreatitis [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Necrotizing pancreatitis results in vascular leak syndrome leading to increased third space fluid losses and worsening of pancreatic hypoperfusion [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite numerous studies that have evaluated intravenous hydration, the timing, the rate, the type of fluid, the duration of treatment, and the appropriate goal to direct such intravenous hydration is unclear [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. While previous guidelines have recommended 250 to 500 mL/hour of normal
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">
          saline
         </a>
         during the first 24 to 48 hours (5 to 10 mL per kilogram of body weight per hour), evidence from randomized controlled trials suggest that a lower volume may be used in patients with mild acute pancreatitis [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4,17,18
         </a>
         ]. In a randomized trial, 249 patients with acute pancreatitis were randomly assigned to aggressive fluid resuscitation (
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108196" href="/z/d/drug information/108196.html" rel="external">
          lactated Ringer
         </a>
         's solution bolus of 20 mL/kg followed by 3 mL/kg/hour) versus moderate resuscitation (1.5 mL/kg/hour with a 10 mL/kg bolus only in patients with hypovolemia) [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. In both groups, initial physical assessment was performed at three hours to evaluate for fluid overload, and goal-directed resuscitation was adjusted 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours based on volume status. Although there was no difference in the incidence of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis or duration of hospitalization between the two groups, the trial was terminated early due to higher rates of fluid overload in the aggressive resuscitation group (20 versus 6 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         We use moderate intravenous hydration (1.5 mL/kg/hour with a 10 mL/kg bolus in patients with hypovolemia) with goal-directed therapy for fluid management [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Fluid requirements are reassessed at frequent intervals in the first six hours of admission and for the next 24 to 48 hours. The rate of fluid resuscitation is adjusted based on clinical assessment, hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine values [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Adequate fluid replacement can be assessed by an improvement in vital signs (goal heart rate &lt;120 beats/minute, mean arterial pressure between 65 to 85 mmHg), urine output (&gt;0.5 to 1 cc/kg/hour) and reduction in hematocrit (goal 35 to 44 percent) and BUN over 24 hours, particularly if they were high at the onset [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,20
         </a>
         ]. Monitoring the BUN may be particularly important, as both the BUN at the time of admission and the change in BUN during the first 24 hours of hospitalization predict mortality [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Increased fluid resuscitation should be considered in patients whose BUN levels stay the same or increase. It is important to note that a low urine output may reflect the development of acute tubular necrosis rather than persistent volume depletion. In this setting, aggressive fluid replacement can lead to peripheral and pulmonary edema without improving the urine output. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7216.html" rel="external">
          "Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         There is conflicting evidence that fluid resuscitation with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108196" href="/z/d/drug information/108196.html" rel="external">
          lactated Ringer

          19,22-24

         ]. In rare patients with acute pancreatitis due to hypercalcemia, lactated Ringer's is contraindicated because it contains 3 mEq/L calcium. In these patients, normal saline should be used for volume resuscitation. Several other approaches to fluid replacement have also been reported in patients with acute pancreatitis [

         It is important to limit fluid resuscitation mainly to the first 24 to 48 hours after onset of the disease. Continued aggressive fluid resuscitation after 48 hours may not be advisable as overly vigorous fluid resuscitation is associated with an increased need for intubation and increased risk of abdominal compartment syndrome.

          Infected necrosis

          61,62

Clinical signs of infection and abdominal imaging demonstrating the presence of gas within the necrosis are reasonably suggestive of infection and antibiotic therapy can be initiated without aspiration and culture [

         </a>
         ]. However, in stable patients with infected necrosis, we attempt to delay necrosectomy by continuing antibiotics for at least four weeks. Continued conservative management of necrotic fluid collection allows a minimally invasive debridement to be performed at a later date to clear necrotic debris [

Interim percutaneous drainage may be needed in patients with infected necrosis who exhibit clinical deterioration or fail to improve, but do not have a walled-off necrotic collection. However, routine immediate drainage once infected necrosis is diagnosed does not improve outcomes. This was demonstrated in a multicenter, randomized trial in which 104 patients were randomly assigned to immediate drainage (55 patients) or postponed drainage (49 patients) when necrotic collections were largely walled-off, but there was either clinical deterioration or lack of improvement [

Thirty-nine percent of infected necrosis improved just with antibiotics without the need for any other intervention. Necrosectomy should be accomplished initially by a minimally invasive approach (endoscopic or percutaneous radiologic). Surgical necrosectomy should be used if minimally invasive methods are not possible or fail [

         In addition to treating pancreatic inflammation and its associated complications in patients with acute pancreatitis, it is important to address the underlying predisposing factors. For example, drugs associated with acute pancreatitis should be discontinued. (See

         In patients with gallstone pancreatitis, most stones pass into the duodenum. However, in a small proportion of patients, obstructive stones in the biliary tract or ampulla of Vater can cause persistent biliary and pancreatic duct obstruction leading to acute pancreatitis and cholangitis.

         Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should be performed early in the course (within 24 hours of admission) for patients with gallstone pancreatitis and cholangitis. Other indications for ERCP include patients with common bile duct obstruction (visible stone on imaging), dilated common bile duct, or increasing liver tests without cholangitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the absence of common bile duct obstruction, ERCP is not indicated for (mild or severe) gallstone pancreatitis without cholangitis. When in doubt about bile duct obstruction in the absence of cholangitis, liver tests can be rechecked in 24 to 48 hours to determine if they improve or a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) could be performed to determine if there are stones in the common bile duct.

         In patients who are found to have stones on EUS or MRCP, ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction is necessary and will prevent future attacks of biliary pancreatitis.

        <p>
         In those patients initially diagnosed as interstitial acute biliary pancreatitis and undergoing same admission cholecystectomy, a high white count or presence of SIRS indicates evolving necrotizing pancreatitis and cholecystectomy in those patients resulted in higher incidence of organ failure and infected necrosis [

          85
         </a>
         ]. A repeat CT scan before cholecystectomy is advised. In patients who have had severe necrotizing pancreatitis, cholecystectomy should be delayed until active inflammation subsides and fluid collections resolve or stabilize [

          86

        <p>
         If the clinical suspicion of common bile duct stones is high (eg, in those with persistent or worsening liver test abnormalities or cholangitis), a preoperative ERCP is the best test as there is a high likelihood that therapeutic intervention (sphincterotomy, stone extraction) will be required. If the suspicion of persistent common bile duct stones is low (eg, if liver tests normalize), an intraoperative cholangiogram during cholecystectomy is preferable to avoid the morbidity associated with ERCP. In patients with low to moderate likelihood, MRCP or EUS should be performed preoperatively to exclude common bile duct stones [
         <a href="#rid87">
          87

         Most patients with biliary sludge are asymptomatic. However, biliary sludge is commonly found in 20 to 40 percent of patients with acute pancreatitis with no other obvious cause. On ultrasound, sludge appears as a mobile, low-amplitude echo that layers in the most dependent part of the gallbladder and is not associated with shadowing. However, ultrasound has a low sensitivity for biliary sludge. If the cause is not clear, we perform EUS, even after one attack, to look for microlithiasis in the gallbladder or bile duct. Cholecystectomy should be performed in patients who have had an episode of pancreatitis and have biliary sludge [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31,35
         </a>

         <a href="#rid88">
          88,89
         </a>
         ]. In a randomized trial, 85 patients, after their first attack of idiopathic acute pancreatitis, were assigned to laparoscopic cholecystectomy or conservative watchful waiting [
         <a href="#rid90">
          90
         </a>
         ]. During a median follow-up of 36 months, significantly fewer patients who had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy had recurrent idiopathic acute pancreatitis as compared with controls (10 versus 30 percent). A total of five patients needed to be treated to prevent one episode of what was thought to be idiopathic acute pancreatitis. However, EUS was not performed to detect small gallstones or biliary sludge. Biliary stones or sludge were detected during surgery in 23 of 39 patients (59 percent) who underwent cholecystectomy.

          Classification of acute pancreatitis
         </strong>
         – Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory process of the pancreas. Acute pancreatitis can be divided into two broad categories: edematous, interstitial acute pancreatitis and necrotizing acute pancreatitis. Mild acute pancreatitis is characterized by the absence of organ failure and local or systemic complications. Moderately severe acute pancreatitis is characterized by no organ failure or transient organ failure (&lt;48 hours) and/or local complications. Severe acute pancreatitis is characterized by persistent organ failure (&gt;48 hours) that may involve one or multiple organs. (See
         <a class="local">

         </a>

         <strong>
          Initial evaluation
         </strong>
         – At initial evaluation, the severity of acute pancreatitis should be assessed by clinical examination to assess for early fluid losses, organ failure  (

         ), and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) score. Routine abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan is not recommended at initial presentation in patients with acute pancreatitis unless there is uncertainty about the diagnosis. (See

         <strong>
          Fluid replacement
         </strong>
         – Acute pancreatitis is treated with supportive care including pain control, goal-directed intravenous fluids especially during the first 24 hours, and correction of electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities. The majority of patients with mild pancreatitis require no further therapy, and recover within three to seven days. Patients with moderately severe and severe pancreatitis require more intensive monitoring as they have transient (&lt;48 hours) or persistent (&gt;48 hours) organ failure and local or systemic complications.

         <strong>
          Pain control
         </strong>
         – Abdominal pain is often the predominant symptom in patients with acute pancreatitis. Adequate pain control requires the use of intravenous opiates, such as

          morphine

         <strong>
          Nutrition
         </strong>
         – In patients with mild pancreatitis, recovery generally occurs quickly, making it unnecessary to initiate supplemental nutrition. A soft diet can be started early (within 24 hours) as tolerated if the pain is decreasing and inflammatory markers are improving. We usually start with a low-residue, low-fat, and soft diet, provided there is no evidence of ileus or significant nausea and/or vomiting.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In patients with severe pancreatitis, we recommend enteral nutrition through a nasojejunal tube placed endoscopically or radiologically rather than initiating

          Indications for follow-up imaging
         </strong>
         – Patients with moderately severe or severe acute pancreatitis, signs of sepsis, or clinical deterioration 72 hours after initial presentation, should undergo a contrast-enhanced CT scan to assess the presence of pancreatic or extrapancreatic necrosis and local complications. Patients with persistent organ failure and extensive local complications should be transferred to centers of expertise. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management of complications'

         <strong>
          Complications of acute pancreatitis
         </strong>
         – Patients with pancreatitis may develop local or systemic complications. Local complications of acute pancreatitis include acute peripancreatic fluid collection, pancreatic pseudocyst, acute necrotic collection (ANC), and walled-off necrosis (WON)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87683" href="/z/d/graphic/87683.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). While acute peripancreatic fluid collections and acute necrotic collections may develop less than four weeks after the onset of pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst and walled-off necrosis usually occur more than four weeks after the onset of acute pancreatitis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Local complications'

         <strong>
          Patients with infected necrosis
         </strong>
         – Both acute necrotic collection and WON are initially sterile but may become infected. The occurrence of pancreatic infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Infected necrosis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88436" href="/z/d/graphic/88436.html" rel="external">
          image 4
         </a>
         ) should be suspected in patients with pancreatic or extrapancreatic necrosis who deteriorate (clinical instability or sepsis physiology, increasing white blood cell count, fevers) or fail to improve after 7 to 10 days of hospitalization. In patients with suspected infected necrosis, we suggest empiric antibiotics rather than CT-guided fine needle aspiration (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). (See

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients with infected necrosis who fail to respond to antibiotics or who are clinically unstable, may require pancreatic debridement. Where possible, we attempt to delay intervention until four weeks after initial presentation to allow the infected necrosis to become walled off. We perform necrosectomy with minimally invasive methods and reserve open surgical debridement for patients who are clinically unstable or if minimally invasive debridement is not possible or fails.

         <strong>
          Patients with gallstone pancreatitis
         </strong>
         – In patients with gallstone pancreatitis, we recommend urgent (&lt;24 hours) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and sphincterotomy for patients with cholangitis (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
